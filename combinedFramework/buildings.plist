		<string>The Arts and Science Undergraduate Society is the student governing body of the Faculty of Arts and Science. The Society was founded in 1891 and is one of the oldest faculty societies in Canada.
            
The ASUS mandate is to provide opportunities for students outside of the classroom to enrich their experience at Queen’s University as an Arts and Science undergraduate.
                
The ASUS President reports to the Dean of Arts and Science and represents the Faculty on the President’s Caucus, which is comprised of the President of every Faculty Society.</string>
		<string>Completed in 1957, this neo-Georgian building at the corner of Arch and Deacon Streets was the first building on campus dedicated to the study of the science of physiology and initially was called the Physiology Building.
                
A plaque erected inside the entrance recognizes the generous gift from local businessman Harry Abramsky and his wife Ethel who donated the funds for its construction. In 1974, on the recommendation of Principal Ronald Watts, the building was renamed in their honour.
                
The Physiology Department has since moved, and the building now houses a variety of health-related academic units. It is designed in the neo-Georgian style and clad in Queenston limestone.
                
In 2011, Queen&apos;s School of Medicine incorporated the south exterior wall of Abramsky Hall.</string>
		<string>Completed in 1952, this building is the second oldest residence on campus. It is located at the corner of University Avenue and Stuart Street.
            
Adelaide Hall was made possible by a gift from Adelaide McLaughlin, the wife of R.S. McLaughlin, who was President of General Motors of Canada and a generous benefactor of Queen&apos;s University.
                
The building was erected because of the urgent need for a new women&apos;s residence; for thirty years the only residence on campus had been Ban Righ Hall and there were nowhere near enough places for all applicants.
                
Adelaide Hall still serves as a women-only residence. It was built to connect with Ban Righ Hall and is faced with Queenston limestone.</string>
		<string>&quot;The Agnes&quot; is one of Canada&apos;s most respected art museums, with a permanent collection of more than 14,000 pieces.
                
The collection ranges from the 14th century to the present, with an emphasis on Canadian art. It includes paintings, sculptures, and graphics by major Canadian artists, European old master paintings – including two works by Rembrandt -, costumes, quilts, silver and other decorative objects, Inuit art, and one of the largest public collections of African art in Canada. Exhibitions from the permanent collection are complemented by travelling exhibitions and a variety of public programs.</string>
		<string>The Ann Baillie Building, a former nurses&apos; residence, built in 1904 to attract the &quot;right kind of lady to nursing,&quot; has been the home to The Museum of Health Care at Kingston since 1995. The building is a beautiful 1904 Beaux-Arts style limestone structure and National Historic Site commemorating the history of nursing education in Canada.</string>
		<string>Ban Righ was officially opened in October of 1925 by the Viscountess Byng of Vimy, the wife of the Governor General. Adelaide Hall was added to it in 1951-2 and an expanded dining hall was added in 1967-68. The residence&apos;s dining hall was renovated in 1996 to accommodate growing numbers of students in residences, as well as to modernize food services at the University.
                
The term &quot;ban righ&quot; is Gaelic for &quot;wife of the King&quot; - or, in other words, &quot;Queen.&quot; The name was suggested by Professor Macgillivray when the original name chosen by the alumnae, &quot;Banrighinn Hall,&quot; was called into question because of the possibility of it being confused with a Mr. Brannigan, who was the owner of a local theatre.</string>
		<string>Beamish-Munro Hall, located at the corner of Union Street and Division Street, is named in honour of the families of Robert Beamish (Sci’60) and Donald Munro (Sci’52). It is the home of the Integrated Learning Centre and Faculty of Engineering and Applied Science.
                
The building opened in May 2004, and in 2005 it was selected as one of the most environmentally advanced buildings in Canada. This recognition by the Sustainable Buildings &apos;05 Canadian Team was part of the fourth International Green Building Challenge (GBC) 2005.
                
Beamish-Munro Hall is a student-oriented building, designed in collaboration with students.</string>
		<string>Officially opened on November 28, 1997, the BioSciences Complex houses the Department of Biology, PARTEQ, and various other science and technology-oriented departments.
                
The complex features a large atrium with student study space and art displays, large lecture halls used by many different departments, and the Queen&apos;s Phytotron, featuring a number of greenhouses.
                
The $52 million BioSciences Complex is equipped with some of Canada&apos;s most sophisticated facilities for research in biotechnology and molecular science. Bringing together researchers from many different faculties and departments, the complex facilitates research collaboration and has strengthened the role of Queen&apos;s as a leader in scientific scholarship.</string>
		<string>Completed in 1979, this nine-story building, located next to Kingston General Hospital, is the main health sciences building at Queen&apos;s. It was made possible by the new provincial funding that became available to Queen&apos;s after it joined forces with local hospitals and agreed to coordinate its activities with them in a cooperative health sciences complex.
                
Botterell Hall contains classrooms, labs, the Centre for Neuroscience Studies, and the Bracken Health Sciences Library.
                
A large addition to Botterell Hall for heart, stroke, and cancer research was opened in 1992.
                
The building is named after Edmund Harry Botterell, a neurosurgeon, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine from 1962 to 1970, and Vice-Principal (Health Sciences) from 1968 to 1971.</string>
		<string>To honour their many years of service to Queen’s, this residence is named in honour of Drs. Marlene Brant Castellano and Clare Clifton Brant. It opened in 2015.</string>
		<string>Built in 1931 and substantially enlarged in 1973, Miller Hall is named after Willet Green Miller, a professor of Geology and Petrology at Queen&apos;s and Ontario&apos;s chief Geologist (1902-1925), and is home to the Department of Geological Sciences and Geological Engineering.
                
It is located on Union Street opposite the foot of Division Street.

The building, constructed in the Collegiate Gothic style, also contains the Miller Museum of Geology. The Bruce Wing, built in 1973, is attached to the southwest corner of Miller Hall. It is named after Everend Lester Bruce, a Professor of Geology at Queen&apos;s (1914-1949) and head of the department (1944-1949).</string>
		<string>This Institute was formally established by the Board of Trustees in June 2001. Its goal is to create an environment that represents the full spectrum of cancer research and to provide opportunities for collaborative research and multidisciplinary training.
                
The Institute has three divisions: Cancer Biology and Genetics, which includes the Cancer Research Laboratories plus investigators with a primary focus on Cancer Genetics; Cancer Clinical Trials, which includes the NCIC Clinical Trials Group; and Cancer Care and Epidemiology, which includes the Radiation Oncology Research Unit plus investigators with a primary interest in environmental causes of cancer.
                
The three divisions are supported by a large number of faculty, graduate and post-doctoral trainees and support staff.</string>
		<string>Built in 1890, Carruthers Hall is one of the oldest buildings on campus: only Summerhill, Theological Hall, and the Old Medical Building are older.
                
It was the first building at Queen&apos;s built for strictly scientific purposes and the money for it was raised as part of the famous Jubilee Campaign, with more than half of it contributed by John Carruthers, a Kingston businessman who helped Principal Grant in his efforts to convince the Board of Trustees to ask the government to establish the School of Mining and Agriculture.
                
The building was designed by Professors Nathan Fellowes Dupuis and William Lawton Goodwin after they spent some time visiting American universities for inspiration. Due to budget constraints, when the building opened in 1891 as the new science hall, it wasn&apos;t fully furnished.
                
It now holds the CFRC Radio Station, the Gordon Vogt Studio Theatre, and a variety of offices.</string>
		<string>Completed in 1969, the Cataraqui Building is one of two buildings at Queen&apos;s named after waterways in the Kingston region; the other is the Rideau Building. The St. Lawrence Building, which was torn down to make room for the construction of Chernoff Hall, was also named for a Kingston waterway, and all three of these buildings were constructed at about the same time.
                
The Cataraqui Building has been the home of the School of Nursing since 1982.</string>
		<string>Chernoff Auditorium stands adjacent to Chernoff Hall. It&apos;s a large lecture hall, and seats 250 students.</string>
		<string>Established through the efforts of the Chernoff family, this $59 million, state of the art facility has been home to the Department of Chemistry since its completion in the Fall of 2002.

Located on Bader Lane across from Victoria Hall (on the site of the former St.Lawrence Building, which was torn down to make room for the new construction), this five-floor structure houses both &quot;wet&quot; sections (laboratory-based) and &quot;dry&quot; sections (administrative-based). Of its more than 14,000 square metres of space, more than 5,000m² is devoted to lab space.</string>
		<string>Chown Hall, completed in 1960, was the third residence to be built on campus.
                
Its completion brought the total available residence places for women up to 435, which, in 1960, was about half the total number of women students at Queen&apos;s. It became a mixed gender environment in 2011.
                
Queen&apos;s had some difficulty purchasing the land for Chown Hall due to the reluctance of various parties to sell their land, or at least to sell it at a price which Queen&apos;s considered reasonable.
                
The many residences built during this period were part of the vision of Principal Mackintosh, who wanted a special place for Queen&apos;s as close-knit, residential university.
                
The building is named after May Chown (BA 1911), treasurer for many years of the Ban Righ Board and daughter of Queen’s long-time treasurer, G.Y. Chown.</string>
		<string>Built between 1949 and 1951, Clark Hall houses the Campus Bookstore and the Clark Hall Pub, run by engineering students.
                
It was constructed on the west side of Campus Road (on a site formerly occupied by the Old Mill, a machine shop for engineering students) with money provided entirely by the engineering students, including a significant donation from the Fifth Field Company, a unit of Queen&apos;s students which served in WWI.
                
The building was intended to provide a meeting place for engineering students -and for many years it was home to the Engineering Society before its offices moved into Beamish-Munro Hall - and a permanent home for the bookstore, which was then called the Technical Supplies Store.

Clark Hall has been expanded several times: the first addition was completed in 1958 and the second in 1963.
                
Since 1971, Clark Hall has been the home of the pub run by the Engineering Society and attending &quot;Ritual&quot; at Clark Hall Pub - the oldest of the three campus bars - is a tradition remembered fondly by many alumni.
                
Clark Hall was named in honour of Arthur Lewis Clark, Dean of Applied Science from 1919 until 1943.</string>
		<string>The Queen&apos;s University Coastal Engineering Laboratory is an integral part of the Civil Engineering Department&apos;s undergraduate courses, graduate programs, academic research, and commercial model testing. Laboratory facilities for hydraulics and fluid mechanics occupy 600 m2 at the main campus, but this lab provides an additional 1,860 m2 of space. Here coastal engineering problems are studied in three 61 m long and one 30.5 m long wave flumes, a 21m x 21m coastal models basin, an oscillating water tunnel, and closed pipelines.</string>
		<string>Completed in 1938, the Craine Building adjoins Humphrey Hall on the north side and was the first of many at Queen&apos;s to be constructed with a facing of buff-coloured Queenston limestone instead of the usual grey Kingston limestone.
                
It was the only major construction effort undertaken by Queen&apos;s during the Depression and was made possible by a gift from Agnes Douglas Craine, who graduated in 1888 from the Queen&apos;s-affiliated women&apos;s medical college.
                
Agnes named the building in honour of her parents, John Joseph and Agnes Muir Craine, and her brother John Craine.
                
She endowed the building specifically for teaching and research in biochemistry; it was used for that purpose until the 1970s</string>
		<string>Completed in 2015, this residence is named for former principal David Chadwick Smith. Smith was a Professor of Economics and as Queen&apos;s 16th Principal from 1984-1994.</string>

		<string>Duncan McArthur Hall is one of the few buildings located on the west campus of Queen&apos;s University. The campus is located about two kilometres west of the main campus and was purchased by Queen&apos;s in 1969. Before Queen&apos;s bought the 61-acre area, it held a farm and a stone quarry, both of which were worked by inmates of the Kingston Penitentiary.
                
Duncan McArthur Hall, built between 1969 and 1971 with funding from the Ontario government, is a very large building which houses Queen&apos;s Faculty of Education, made up of administrative offices, classrooms, labs, technical shops, and the large Education Library.</string>
		<string>Dunning Hall was built in 1960 and is faced with Queenston limestone. It originally housed the departments of Economics, Political Science, Geography, and Sociology, as well as the School of Industrial Relations and the School of Commerce.
                
As each of these departments expanded and new buildings were erected, most of these departments moved out and the purpose of Dunning Hall became more specialized.
                
It housed Queen&apos;s School of Business for many years, but on the completion of Goodes Hall in the fall of 2002, it became the home of the Department of Economics.</string>
