# qtap-ios
An open-source iOS application for current Queen's University students, that syncs class information from SOLUS.

The early form of QTap was initially developed by first-year engineering students at Queen's University, as as a design project for APSC-100. Development work was supported over the course of the 2015 summer, by a joint partnership between Queen's IT Services and the Faculty of Applied Science. 

QTap incorporates a strong, organized visual design for displaying daily class schedules, operating hours for on-campus buildings, and helpful university contact information for Queen's students.

This repository contains the official source code for <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/qtap/id1020326652?mt=8">QTap for iOS</a>.
